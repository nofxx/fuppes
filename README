== Introduction ==

Welcome to, and thankyou for downloading, FUPPES (Free UPnP Entertainment Service)!

FUPPES is a free, multiplatform UPnP A/V Media Server. FUPPES supports a wide 
range of UPnP MediaRenderers as well as on-the-fly transcoding of various audio, 
video and image formats. FUPPES also includesbasic DLNA support.


== Basic Installation ==

FUPPES uses standard GNU automake and as such all it requires to install is a:

  autoreconf -vfi   # step 1
  ./configure       # step 2
  make              # step 3
  make install      # step 4

It should be noted that before step 2 you may like to try './configure --help' to see
what your options are and then run './configure' with the options that you want.
And on Debian based systems you will likely need to prefix the 'sudo' command 
to the 'make install' so that it will run with the right privileges.


== Security Notice ==

The only times that fuppes will require 'root' priveliges are:

  1) When you are dealing with the init.d script.
  2) When you are installing a packaged version of fuppes.
  3) When you are running make install.

For security reasons fuppes should not be run as root at any other time.

== How I managed to install FUPPES ==
After endless hours of fighting against non-existing identifiers and crying myself
to sleep, I can now enjoy my home UPnP server executing the commands you will find
a little bit further down. As all the process was carried out on Ubuntu Server
12.04.3, I installed the following dependencies:
 ffmpeg build-essential libavutil-dev libavformat-dev libavcodec-dev libtool \
 automake autoconf libsqlite3-dev libpcre3-dev libxml12-dev libtwolame-dev \
 libffmpegthumbnailer-dev libmagickwand-dev libsimage-dev libtaglib-cil-dev \
 libtaglib-ocaml-dev libmp3lame-dev

Finally, these are the necessary commands:

$ autoreconf -vfi
$ ./configure --sysconfdir=/etc --localstatedir=/var --prefix=/usr \
 --enable-lame --enable-twolame --enable-transcoder-ffmpeg --enable-magickwand \
 --enable-mp4v2 --enable-vorbis --enable-flac --enable-mad --enable-faad \
 --enable-dlna --enable-inotify
Please note that the previous step has a lot of enabled codecs. Each one of
them requires you to find the associated library through `aptitude search'.
$ make
$ sudo make install
$ sudo adduser --system --home /var/lib/fuppes --shell /bin/sh --group --no-create-home fuppes
$ sudo chown -R fuppes:fuppes /var/lib/fuppes
$ sudo cp daemon/fuppesd.txt /etc/init.d/fuppesd
$ sudo chmod +x /etc/init.d/fuppesd
$ sudo update-rc.d fuppesd defaults 60
